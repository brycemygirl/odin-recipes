    <p>My homemade mac & cheese, inspired by a recipe from America's Test Kitchen.</p>

    <p>Homestyle stovetop mac & cheese is a disc you might think you have to live without on a vegan diet - the word "chese" is in the name, after all...</p>
    <p>Our winning formula was a mixture of cashews, cauliflower, and almond milk that we simmered together and blended until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>coconut oil</li>
        <li>nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>dry mustard</li>
        <li>tamato paste</li>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
