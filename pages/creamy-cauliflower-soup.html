    <p>A bowl of this delicious soup! The cauliflower piece here is just for show.</p>

    <p>Gosh, Kendall is such an asshole. And an idiot who lacks any and all self-awareness. He thinks that he's invincible, so he's cool with people ragging on him, but it's only because he doesn't think anyone will be able to hurt him. And he's so willing to hurt his famiy without considering the possibility that they will take it personally and start to hurt him back.</p>
    <p>He's also pretty paranoid. There's no way that they were actually messing with his AC (otherwise I think that his new assistant would have agreed with him). He just thinks he's getting attack from every angle.</p>
